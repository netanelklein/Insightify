**Last Updated**: June 17, 2025  
**Effective Date**: [TO BE SET BEFORE PRODUCTION]

## Introduction

Insightify ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application Insightify - Spotify Data Analyzer ("the App").

## Information We Collect

### 1. Data You Provide Directly
- **Spotify Data Files**: JSON files containing your personal Spotify listening history that you voluntarily import
- **App Preferences**: Settings and customizations you make within the app

### 2. Data We Do NOT Collect

- **Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the app or collect usage statistics

- **Location Data**: We do not access or collect your location information

## How We Handle Your Data

### Local Processing Only
- **All data processing occurs locally** on your device
- **No data is transmitted** to our servers or third-party services
- **Your Spotify data never leaves your device** unless you explicitly choose to share insights

### Data Storage
- All imported data is stored locally in your device's secure app storage
- Data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app
- You can manually delete all data at any time through app settings

### Optional Spotify API Integration
If you choose to connect your Spotify account (optional feature):
- We use OAuth 2.0 authentication (industry standard)
- We only access publicly available metadata (artist info, album covers)
- We do not access your private playlists or personal information
- You can revoke access at any time through Spotify's app settings

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### We Do Not Share Your Data
- We never sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties
- We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes
- We do not create user profiles for commercial purposes

### Legal Requirements
We may only disclose information if required by law, but since we don't collect personal data, there's minimal risk of this affecting you.

## Your Rights and Controls

### Full Control Over Your Data
- **Import**: You control what data to import into the app
- **Delete**: Remove all data at any time through app settings
- **Export**: Export your insights without personal identifiers
- **Disconnect**: Revoke Spotify API access at any time

### No Account Required
- The app works without creating an account
- No registration or sign-up process
- No password or login credentials stored

## Security

### Data Protection Measures
- All data is stored in your device's secure app sandbox
- Industry-standard encryption for data at rest
- Secure authentication protocols for optional Spotify integration
- No data transmission reduces attack surface

### Regular Security Updates
We regularly update the app to address any potential security vulnerabilities.

## Children's Privacy

The app is suitable for all ages and does not collect any personal information from children or adults. Since all processing is local, there are no additional privacy concerns for underage users.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on our website with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Third-Party Services

### Spotify Web API (Optional)
If you choose to use Spotify integration:
- Governed by [Spotify's Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/privacy)
- We only access public metadata, not personal information
- You can use the app fully without this integration

### No Other Third Parties
We do not integrate with any other third-party services that could access your data.

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Retained until you delete it or uninstall the app
- **No Server Data**: We don't retain any data on our servers
- **Spotify API Tokens**: Stored securely and can be revoked at any time

## International Users

Since all data processing is local to your device, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns. The app works the same way regardless of your location.
