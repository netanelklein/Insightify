# Production Deployment Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up Insightify for production deployment to Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

1. âœ… **Google Play Console Account** - Developer account with app registration
2. âœ… **Production Signing Key** - Android keystore for app signing
3. âœ… **Spotify App Registration** - Production Spotify API credentials
4. âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflows (already implemented)

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Google Play Console Setup

#### A. Create App in Play Console
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create new app: "Insightify - Spotify Data Analyzer"
3. Complete app information:
   - **Category**: Music & Audio
   - **Content Rating**: Everyone
   - **Privacy Policy**: Required (create one)
   - **Target Audience**: All ages

#### B. Generate Service Account for CI/CD
1. Go to Setup â†’ API access in Play Console
2. Create new service account in Google Cloud Console
3. Download JSON key file
4. Grant permissions in Play Console:
   - Release manager
   - Editor (for app info updates)

#### C. Prepare Store Listing
- **App Description**: Ready in `distribution/store_listing/`
- **Screenshots**: Capture from app (5 phones, 2 tablets minimum)
- **Feature Graphic**: 1024 x 500 px banner
- **App Icon**: Already in `android/app/src/main/res/`

### 2. Android App Signing

#### A. Generate Production Keystore
```bash
# Run this command to create production keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore insightify-release-key.jks \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
        -alias insightify-key

# Convert to base64 for GitHub secrets
base64 -i insightify-release-key.jks -o keystore.base64
```

#### B. Update Build Configuration
The `android/app/build.gradle` is already configured for release signing.
Just ensure the keystore is properly referenced.

### 3. Spotify API Production Setup

#### A. Create Production Spotify App
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create new app: "Insightify Production"
3. Set redirect URIs:
   - `insightify://callback`
   - `https://your-domain.com/callback` (if web version planned)
4. Note down Client ID and Client Secret

#### B. Request Extended Quota (if needed)
If planning for more than 25 users, request quota extension from Spotify.

### 4. GitHub Repository Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

#### Required for Production Deployment:
```
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=<service-account-json-content>
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64=<base64-encoded-keystore>
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<keystore-password>
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=insightify-key
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=<key-password>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<production-spotify-client-id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<production-spotify-client-secret>
```

#### Optional for Enhanced CI/CD:
```
CODECOV_TOKEN=<codecov-token-for-coverage>
SLACK_WEBHOOK=<slack-webhook-for-notifications>
```

### 5. Production Release Process

#### A. Prepare Release Branch
```bash
# Ensure dev is up to date and stable
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Run full test suite
flutter test
flutter analyze
./scripts/local-ci.sh

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
```

#### B. Update Version Information
1. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   version: 1.0.0+1  # version+build_number
   ```

2. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**:
   ```gradle
   versionCode 1
   versionName "1.0.0"
   ```

3. **Create release notes** in `distribution/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-US`

#### C. Create Production PR
```bash
# Commit version updates
git add pubspec.yaml android/app/build.gradle distribution/whatsnew/
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0 for production release"

# Push and create PR to main
git push origin release/v1.0.0
# Create PR: release/v1.0.0 â†’ main
```

#### D. Deploy to Production
1. **Merge PR to main** â†’ Triggers CD workflow
2. **Monitor deployment** in GitHub Actions
3. **Verify in Play Console** â†’ Internal testing track
4. **Promote to Beta** â†’ Manual approval in Play Console
5. **Release to Production** â†’ Staged rollout (1% â†’ 100%)

### 6. Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### A. Set Up Monitoring
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Add to project for crash reporting
- **Firebase Performance**: Monitor app performance metrics
- **Play Console**: Monitor user feedback and ratings

#### B. Release Health Metrics
Monitor these KPIs:
- **Crash-free rate**: > 99.5%
- **ANR rate**: < 0.1%
- **App size**: < 50MB
- **Startup time**: < 3 seconds
- **User rating**: > 4.0 stars

### 7. Hotfix Process

For critical issues in production:

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix-v1.0.1

# Make minimal fix
# Update version to 1.0.1+2
# Test thoroughly

# Fast-track to production
git push origin hotfix/critical-fix-v1.0.1
# Create PR: hotfix/critical-fix-v1.0.1 â†’ main
# Merge immediately after review
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- âœ… **Never commit secrets** to version control
- âœ… **Use GitHub Secrets** for all sensitive data
- âœ… **Rotate keys regularly** (annually for signing keys)
- âœ… **Limit access** to production secrets

### App Security
- âœ… **Code obfuscation** enabled in release builds
- âœ… **Network security** with certificate pinning
- âœ… **Input validation** implemented throughout app
- âœ… **Error handling** prevents information leakage
