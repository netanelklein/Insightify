# Insightify - Spotify Data Analyzer

## Project Overview

Insightify is a Flutter mobile application that allows users to analyze their Spotify listening data. The app imports user's downloaded Spotify data files (either Extended or Account data) and provides visualizations and statistics about their listening habits, including top artists, tracks, albums, and listening patterns.

## Key Features

- Import and parse Spotify data from JSON files
- View top artists, tracks, and albums based on listening history
- View total streaming time and most streamed days
- Display average listening time per day statistics
- View listening history with sorting options
- Time of day listening pattern visualization
- Dedicated pages for artists and albums with detailed statistics
- Filter data by custom time ranges

## Core Technical Components

1. **Data Models**:
   - StreamHistoryEntry - Represents basic streaming history
   - ExtendedStreamHistoryEntry - Extended data with detailed information
   - StreamHistoryDBEntry - Database representation of streaming history

2. **State Management**:
   - Uses the Provider package for application state management
   - AppState class manages core state like time ranges, loading state, and filtering options

3. **Database**:
   - Uses SQLite through the sqflite package
   - DatabaseHelper manages database operations including querying statistics
   - Stores stream history, artists, and albums information

4. **API Integration**:
   - Connects to Spotify Web API for additional metadata
   - Fetches artist and album information not available in user data

5. **UI Components**:
   - Material design with custom theme
   - Charts and visualizations using fl_chart
   - World map visualization with countries_world_map

## Critical Issues Identified

### âœ… Recently Resolved (December 2024 - June 2025)
1. **JSON File Loading**: âœ… FIXED - Improved Spotify JSON file detection for real user data
   - Updated file type detection to use flexible key matching instead of requiring all optional fields
   - Fixed issue where real Spotify Extended Streaming History files were rejected due to missing optional fields like 'username'
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback in file upload process
   - Successfully tested with 70k+ records from real user Spotify data files
   - Both welcome.dart and database_helper.dart now use consistent detection logic

2. **Security & Input Validation**: âœ… FIXED - Comprehensive security improvements
   - Implemented secrets management with template system and .gitignore protection
   - Added robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
   - Created structured error reporting with severity levels and context tracking
   - Enhanced file upload security with safe JSON validation and error handling
   - Fixed Unicode compatibility issues in RegExp patterns for international content

3. **Test Infrastructure**: âœ… FIXED - Comprehensive testing framework
   - Created unit tests for input validation and error reporting utilities
   - Implemented widget tests with proper Provider pattern integration
   - Added integration tests covering file upload and app initialization workflows
   - Fixed RegExp Unicode handling and AppState context issues in tests

### High Priority (Next Phase)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED - Automated testing and Google Play deployment infrastructure
2. **Memory Management**: Large JSON file processing could cause memory issues on low-end devices
3. **API Efficiency**: Spotify API calls noted as inefficient (multiple TODO comments)
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add real-time performance tracking and memory usage monitoring

### Medium Priority (Phase 1)
1. **Code Organization**: Some TODOs remain unaddressed in codebase
2. **Performance**: No pagination for large datasets in UI components
3. **Proper Logging**: Replace print statements with structured logging

### Future Priority - Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Note**: While we now have solid test infrastructure for validation and error reporting (61 tests), we should eventually expand test coverage to the entire application. This includes:
- All UI components and screens
- Database operations and data models
- Spotify API integration
- Chart and visualization components
- State management flows
- User interaction workflows

This is not urgent but represents good practice for long-term maintainability and reliability.

### Development Workflow Recommendations

#### Git Branching Strategy
1. **Main Branch**: Production-ready code only
2. **Dev Branch**: Integration branch for all feature development
3. **Feature Branches**: Individual branches for each feature (e.g., `feature/track-pages`, `feature/search-functionality`)
4. **Hotfix Branches**: For critical bug fixes that need immediate deployment

#### Suggested Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/dedicated-track-pages`)
- `bugfix/description` (e.g., `bugfix/json-import-error`)
- `hotfix/description` (e.g., `hotfix/database-crash`)
- `chore/description` (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

#### Development Process
1. Create feature branch from dev
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Code review via pull request
4. Merge to dev branch
5. Integration testing
6. Merge dev to main for releases
